# FairX: A comprehensive benchmarking tool for model analysis using fairness, utility, and explainability

Fairness Benchmarking toolkit!

This includes data loader, custom dataset support, different fairness models, and wide range of evaluations.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Fairness Evaluation

- [x] Demographic Parity Ratio (DPR)
- [x] Equilized Odds Ratio (EOR)
- [x] Fairness Through Unawareness (FTU)
- [ ] Intersectional Bias (IB)

### Data Utility

- [x] Accuracy
- [x] AUROC
- [x] F1-score
- [x] Precision
- [x] Recall

### Synthetic Data Evaluation

- [x] $\alpha-$ precision
- [x] $\beta-$ recall
- [x] Authenticity

### Model's performance on Data utiliy vs Fairness

Here, we have compared all the model in our benchmarking tools on Data utility vs Fairness metrics. For the data utlity, we calculate the Accuracy and for the fairness, we measure Demographic Parity Ration (DPR) and Equilized Odds Ratio (EOR), and plot them in 3d.

More results coming soon!
